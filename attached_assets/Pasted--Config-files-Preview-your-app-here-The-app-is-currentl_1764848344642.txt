I'll help you complete the Django project import. Let me first check the current state by examining the logs and project structure.

Major Gaps Cluster Around:

Integrations: Payment gateways, telephony (Wazo), email providers, social media
Background Processing: Celery/Redis not configured, so async features run synchronously
Control Plane Enforcement: Feature flags, audit logs, metrics need activation
Communication Layer: Email/SMS/voice dispatch backends missing
Data Conflicts: Duplicate product catalogs (sales.Product vs products.Product) check if gaps are filled and also wazo to focus on calls+message and is there an opensource option to send grid

Analyzed Wazo and email alternatives
Let me search for available integrations and check the current project state to give you a clear picture.


Searched Replit's integrations for "email sending"

Assessed product catalog structure
Let me also check the current project structure to understand the duplicate product catalogs issue.

Opened core directory

Executed rg -n 'class Product' core

Analyzed gaps, offered alternatives
Based on my analysis, here's a clear breakdown of the gaps and your options:

Current Gap Status
1. Integrations Available via Replit
Service	Status	Notes
Stripe (Payments)	Not set up	Ready to configure through Replit integration
SendGrid (Email)	Not set up	Ready to configure through Replit integration
Resend (Email)	Not set up	Alternative email option available
Twilio (SMS/Voice)	Not set up	Ready for calls + SMS
2. Background Processing (Celery/Redis)
The celery.py files exist in salescompass/ and sCompass/, but Redis isn't running. This means async tasks (email sends, report generation, NPS surveys) currently run synchronously.

3. Duplicate Product Catalogs
I found only one Product model in core/products/models.py. The sales/ app has sales-related models but references the products app. This isn't a true duplicate - they're separate concerns (products catalog vs sales transactions).

Open Source Alternatives
For Email (SendGrid Alternatives)
Option	Best For	Complexity
Listmonk	Newsletters + transactional	Low - single binary, Docker ready
Postal	High-volume transactional	Medium - handles millions/day
useSend	Modern dev experience	Low - great dashboard
My recommendation: Listmonk is easiest to self-host (Go binary, PostgreSQL) and handles both marketing emails and transactional messages.

For Telephony (Wazo)
Wazo Platform is excellent for your needs:

Calls: REST API via wazo-calld - make/receive/control calls
Messaging: Built-in chat via wazo-chatd + SMS through Google Voice integration
WebRTC: Browser-based calling supported
License: GPL 3.0 (fully open source)
The existing communication/wazo_adapter.py in your project suggests you already planned for Wazo integration.

Recommended Next Steps
Would you like me to create a plan to:

Set up Stripe via Replit integration for payments
Configure Celery + Redis for background task processing
Choose an email solution - either SendGrid (quick via Replit) or Listmonk (self-hosted)
Complete Wazo integration for calls and messaging
Activate feature flags and audit logging from your existing code
