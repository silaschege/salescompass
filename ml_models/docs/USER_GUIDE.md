# SalesCompass ML - User Guide for Sales Teams

Welcome to the AI-powered sales cockpit. This guide helps you understand and leverage the insights provided by our Machine Learning module.

## 1. What do these scores mean?

### 🔥 Lead Score (0 - 100)
- **90 - 100 (Hot)**: This lead is ready for immediate outreach. The AI has detected patterns similar to your most successful conversions.
- **70 - 89 (Warm)**: Good potential. Engage with high-quality content or a personalized follow-up.
- **50 - 69 (Nurture)**: The AI recommends more education or marketing drip campaigns before direct sales contact.
- **Below 50 (Low Priority)**: Keep in the system, but focus your energy elsewhere for now.

### 🎯 Win Probability (%)
Found on your Opportunities, this percentage reflects the AI's confidence that the deal will close successfully based on:
- Historical win rates in this industry.
- Deal velocity (how fast it's moving through stages).
- Interaction frequency with the customer.

## 2. Meet your Action Agents
The system doesn't just predict; it helps you work faster through **Action Agents**.

- **Lead Nurture Agent**: 
  - If a lead hits a **Hot** score (90+), this agent immediately alerts you and your manager via Slack/Internal Notification.
  - For **Warm** leads, it automatically schedules a "Follow-up" task in your CRM calendar.

## 3. "Why did I get this score?" (Explainability)
Every AI insight comes with a "Why" section. Common reasons you might see:
- *Positive*: "High website engagement within the last 48 hours."
- *Negative*: "Industry historically has a 50% slower conversion rate."

## 4. Best Practices
- **Feedback Loop**: If you think a score is wrong, update the Lead data (e.g., adding a missing Industry or Company Size). The AI re-calculates the score instantly.
- **Trust but Verify**: Use the AI as a compass to guide your priority, but your human intuition handles the final relationship building.
